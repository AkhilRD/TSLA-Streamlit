# TSLA-Streamlit
Streamlit Application code for a stock prediction model deployed on Streamlit Cloud. 
The aim was to build a model that would mimic Tesla's stock price based on:
- Quarterly Financial Metrics
- Twitter Sentiment
- Reddit Threads
- Price Movement

An ensemble of ML models was used to predict the possible model which resulted in an RMSE of 35. 
(The error would grow gradually as the model is not maintained on a frequent basis)
